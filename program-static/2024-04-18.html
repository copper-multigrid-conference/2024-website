High-dimensional data is ubiquitous across scientific computing disciplines, including plasma physics, fluids, earth systems, and mechanics.  Such data is naturally represented as a tensor, consisting of the value of each simulation variable at each point in space and time.  Tensor decomposition methods, akin to matrix factorization methods for two-dimensional data, facilitate powerful analysis/reduction of such data, including data compression, surrogate modeling, pattern identification, and anomaly detection.  However, existing tensor decomposition methods target simple statistical error metrics, most commonly least-squares loss, resulting in low-rank models of the data that fail to faithfully represent important physics quantities of interest or invariants arising from conservation principles.  In this work, we explore new formulations of two common tensor decomposition methods, the Canonical Polyadic (CP) and Tucker decompositions, that attempt to better preserve these quantities by incorporating them directly in the optimization problems that define the resulting low-rank models.  We then explore solving these optimization problems through penalty methods and investigate their ability to preserve these quantities compared to their overall reconstruction accuracy.  Computational results of applying this approach to CP and Tucker decomposition of data arising from simulation of plasma physics and combustion will be presented.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">08:50</td><td><a name="talk:246495"><div class="authors"><a href="person230.html" class="person">Saibal De</a>, <a href="person229.html" class="person">Hemanth Kolla</a> and <a href="person227.html" class="person">Eric T.

The Tucker decomposition has emerged as a popular format for compressing large datasets generated from high-fidelity scientific simulations. Several software packages (Tensor Toolbox, TuckerMPI) enable computing the Tucker decomposition of static data, but relatively fewer works address compressing a streaming tensor. In this work, we develop a streaming Tucker algorithm, tailored to scientific simulations where the data tensor grows along a single time-like dimension. At any point, we seek to update the existing factorization – the Tucker core and the factor matrices – with a new tensor slice, without accessing the already incorporated tensor slices in their raw, uncompressed form. Throughout this process, we ensure that a user-specified relative error tolerance is met. We present an implementation within the TuckerMPI framework, and apply it to both synthetic and simulated (combustion) datasets. By comparing against the standard (batch) algorithm, we show that our proposed approach provides significant improvements in terms of memory usage. If the Tucker ranks stop growing along the streaming tensor mode, our approach also incurs less wall-time compared to the batch version.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">09:15</td><td><a name="talk:246549"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person231.html">Fan Tian</a>, <a href="person232.html" class="person">Mirjeta Pasha</a>, <a class="person" href="person233.html">Misha Kilmer</a>, <a class="person" href="person234.html">Eric Miller</a> and <a class="person" href="person235.html">Abani Patra</a></div></a><div class="title">Tensor Completion with BMD Factor Nuclear Norm Minimization</div><div class="presenter">PRESENTER: <a href="person231.html" class="person">Fan Tian</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT.

Preconditioned iterative methods based on the Krylov subspace technique are widely employed in various scientific and technical computing. When utilizing large-scale parallel computing systems, the communication overhead tends to increase with the growth in the number of nodes, making its reduction a crucial challenge. In parallel finite element methods (FEM) and finite volume methods (FVM), halo communication and computation overlapping (CC-Overlapping) are commonly employed, often in conjunction with the dynamic loop scheduling feature of OpenMP. This approach has been primarily applied to sparse matrix-vector products (SpMV) and explicit solvers. Previous studies by the author have proposed reordering techniques for applying CC-Overlapping to processes involving global data dependencies, such as the Conjugate Gradient method preconditioned by Incomplete Cholesky Factorization (ICCG). Successful implementations on massively parallel supercomputers demonstrated high parallel performance, but the application of CC-Overlapping was limited to SpMV. In the present work, the author proposes a method to apply CC-Overlapping to the forward and backward substitutions of the IC(0) smoother of the parallel Conjugate Gradient method preconditioned by Multigrid (MGCG). Using up to 4,096 nodes on Wisteria/BDEC-01 (Odyssey) with A64FX, performance improvements of approximately 40+% was achieved compared to the original implementation, while improvement was 20+% on 1,024 nodes of Oakbridge-CX system with Intel Xeon CPU’s.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">08:25</td><td><a name="talk:246528"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person242.html">Stephen Thomas</a>, <a href="person243.html" class="person">Shelby Lockhart</a>, <a class="person" href="person244.html">David Doscher</a> and <a href="person245.html" class="person">Bob Robey</a></div></a><div class="title">Adaptive CSR Krylov Solvers on GPU</div><div class="presenter">PRESENTER: <a class="person" href="person242.html">Stephen Thomas</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. Our study introduces an optimization for Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SpMV) on GPU architectures, essential for high-performance computing (HPC) environments. This method revolves around a data packing strategy that necessitates doubling the storage for non-zero elements of the sparse matrix (2x nnz(A)), achieved by replicating the vector 'x'. This approach optimizes data alignment with the GPU's L1 cache, significantly reducing the indirect addressing overhead and facilitating a 2X improvement in Vector-CSR SpMV operations. Integrated with the Message Passing Interface (MPI), our technique enhances scalability and efficiency, making it well-suited for distributed computing in large-scale HPC systems. In particular, this optimization aids inexact Krylov subspace methods, such as Iterated Gauss-Seidel GMRES (IGS-GMRES). By dynamically adapting to the evolving sparsity patterns of Krylov vectors, our approach effectively reduces both computational and memory access costs without compromising solver convergence. Achieved through the replication of 'x', this strategy serves as a form of dimensional lifting based on the mathematics of arrays (MoA) paradigm due to Prof. L.

Analytic derivation is complicated for many systems, and such derivations must be repeated whenever new physics models are added.

In this talk, we discuss the use of automatic differentiation to construct Jacobian matrices for finite element discretization of compressible computational fluid dynamics equations using the Panzer and Sacado packages from the Trilinos library. Using a forward automatic differentiation approach with dynamically allocated derivative dimensions provides tremendous flexibility but results in potential performance issues for GPU architectures.

X-ray-based computed tomography is a well-established technique for determining the three-dimensional structure of an object from its two-dimensional projections. A major challenge in many experiments is that samples can be rapidly evolving or the field of view is restricted, limiting the number of projections that can be collected. In such cases, commonly used filtered back-projection methods, which directly approximate the inverse Radon transform,  often result in poor-quality reconstructions. In comparison, iterative reconstruction algorithms, such as model-based iterative reconstructions (MBIR), have demonstrated considerable success in producing high-quality reconstructions under such restrictions by incorporating a priori knowledge as a model constraint. However, MBIR implementations have typically required high-performance computing resources with hundreds of compute nodes to solve the problem in a reasonable time, which may not be readily available to experimentalists. </p><p>Here, we introduce TomoCAM, which reformulates the problem in Fourier space via the central slice theorem and leverages GPUs to speed up MBIR significantly. More specifically, TomoCAM computes the Radon transform and its adjoint through non-uniform fast Fourier transforms (NUFFTs), which have lower computational complexity than the ray-tracing methods traditionally used in MBIR. This is coupled with a q-generalized Gaussian Markov random field formulation of the total variation constraint, regularizing the problem with limited projection data. We employ a method based on Nestrov’s accelerated gradients to solve the resulting optimization problem. Furthermore, we exploit asynchronous memory transfers to hide PCIe latency and maximize throughput to the GPU and on-chip shared memory to minimize the expensive readouts from global memory. Using publicly available phantoms and experimental data, we demonstrate that TomoCAM produces results similar to previous MBIR implementations in reconstruction quality, and at the same time, it is 10-15 times faster. Thus, TomoCAM allows experimentalists to obtain high-quality reconstructions from limited projection data in a reasonable time using commonly available computing resources.</p></div></td></tr></table></div><div class="session notalk"><a name="session:80864"><div class="heading"><span class="interval">10:05-10:25</span> <span class="title">Coffee &amp; Tea Service</span></div></a></div><div class="session"><a name="session:80868"><div class="heading"><span class="interval">10:25-12:30</span> <span class="title">Session 12A: Tensor Train Methods [Bighorn B]</span></div></a><div class="session_chair"><div class="chair_word">Chair: </div><div class="chair_names"><a href="person251.html" class="person">Michael Lindsey</a></div></div><table class="talks"><tr class="talk"><td class="time">10:25</td><td><a name="talk:246457"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person251.html">Michael Lindsey</a></div></a><div class="title">Direct interpolative construction of quantized tensor trains</div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT.

solution at all time steps, which only needs to be solved once. The time dimension is equally
treated as a spatial dimension and is discretized with Chebyshev collocation points. This space-

Simulating steady state solutions for advection-diffusion has been of great interest to engineers in order to bypass long transients in thermal fluids applications in complicated domains. The steady advection-diffusion equation is the main system for conjugate heat transfer and for the linearized incompressible Navier-Stokes equations. One challenge to developing a preconditioner of such problems is the boundary layer caused by small diffusivity which raises extra stability issues. </p><p>In this work, we deploy a low-order preconditioner for the steady advection diffusion operator based on the existing collocation points of the spectral element method (SEM). It is feasible to construct the full preconditioner since the number of nonzeros of the low-order matrix in $d$ space dimensions is only $O(N^d)$ rather than $O(N^{2d})$ for the $N$th-order SEM matrix (which is not formed). In the low-order formulation, the convective term is dealiased with a 3-point Gauss rule in order to ensure skew-symmetry. Several local reordering strategies are discussed to reduce the fill of the LU or ILU solver. We provide numerical results for parameter studies and compare our solver with traditional time advancing schemes for benchmark cases from nuclear engineering applications.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">11:40</td><td><a name="talk:246447"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person268.html">Xue Wang</a></div></a><div class="title">A parameter-robust preconditioner for Stokes-Darcy coupling problems</div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. In this talk, we study parameter-robust preconditioners for the coupled Stokes-Darcy system. Existing preconditioners usually involve a fractional operator due to the introduction of Lagrange multipliers or the reduction to a system including only interface flux variables. We aim to develop a parameter-robust preconditioner that does not involve a fractional operator. To this end, we strongly impose the normal flux continuity at the interface in the weak formulation. Following the well-known operator preconditioning framework, we prove the well-posedness of the coupled problems with respect to an appropriately chosen weighted norm and then develop the parameter-robust preconditioner based on the Riesz map. Moreover, we develop an inexact version of the preconditioner by utilizing multilevel techniques. Finally, numerical tests confirm the robustness of the block preconditioners with respect to the physical and discretization parameters without the need for any fractional operators.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">12:05</td><td><a name="talk:246543"><div class="authors"><a class="person" href="person174.html">Long Chen</a>, <a class="person" href="person175.html">Ruchi Guo</a> and <a class="person" href="person173.html">Jingrong Wei</a></div></a><div class="title">Transformed primal-dual methods with variable-preconditioners for nonlinear partial differential equations</div><div class="presenter">PRESENTER: <a class="person" href="person173.html">Jingrong Wei</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. This paper introduces a novel Transformed Primal-Dual with variable-metric/preconditioner (TPDv) algorithm, designed to efficiently solve affine constrained optimization problems common in nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). Diverging from traditional methods, TPDv iteratively updates time-evolving preconditioning operators, enhancing adaptability. The algorithm is derived and analyzed, demonstrating global linear convergence rates under mild assumptions. Numerical experiments on challenging nonlinear PDEs, including the Darcy-Forchheimer model and a nonlinear electromagnetic problem, showcase the algorithm's superiority over existing methods in terms of iteration numbers and computational efficiency.

Inexact Newton method is widely used in many scientific and engineering applications, but in some situations its convergence involves a long stagnation period in which the nonlinear residual doesn't decrease much and a large percentage of the total compute time is wasted. The reasons for the stagnation are quite difficult to quantify. In this paper, we propose a stagnation-shortening inexact Newton algorithm with a stagnation analysis phase during the Newton iterations in which the norms of the residuals are used as a guiding curve and the vector values of the residuals are centralized and decomposed into a slow subspace and a regular subspace using an unsupervised learning method based on principal component analysis. A subspace Newton is then performed in the slow space whose solution is later projected back to the global space. We show numerically that with such an embedded learning phase the inexact Newton method converges almost quadratically. As an application, we consider the modeling of the human artery with stenosis using the hyperelasticity equation with multiple material parameters. Due to the significant difference in the material coefficients between the plaques and the healthy parts of the blood vessels, the problem is nonlinearly very difficult. Numerical experiments demonstrate that proposed method offers significantly reduced number of nonlinear iterations and robustness for this rather tough hyperelasticity problem.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">16:55</td><td><a name="talk:246555"><div class="authors"><a href="person258.html" class="person">Aman Rani</a>, <a class="person" href="person48.html">Pieter Ghysels</a>, <a class="person" href="person259.html">Victoria Howle</a> and <a href="person260.html" class="person">Katharine Long</a></div></a><div class="title">Efficient Solution for Fully Implicit Runge-Kutta Methods for Time-dependent Hyperbolic PDEs</div><div class="presenter">PRESENTER: <a href="person258.html" class="person">Aman Rani</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. We focus on implicit Runge-Kutta (IRK) time stepping of time-dependent hyperbolic PDEs. IRK time stepping of PDEs leads to linear systems with a Kronecker product structure involving the Butcher table and the mass and stiffness matrices. The system arising from IRK-time stepping applied to the wave equation is highly ill-conditioned but has a block structure we exploit. If $N$ is the number of degrees of freedom for the discretization of the PDE, then the resulting matrix after IRK-time stepping is a block $s\times s$ matrix where each block is of size $2N \times 2N$. Traditionally, preconditioning techniques are used for solving these systems, but we reformulated the large $2Ns \times 2Ns$ block structured linear system as a Sylvester matrix equation. That leads to solving s block systems of order $2N \times 2N$ which are solved using $2$ AMG V-cycles. As we increase the Runge-Kutta stages and refine the mesh, our method is twice as fast compared to other existing methods and takes fewer AMG V-cycles.</p></div></td></tr><tr class="talk"><td class="time">17:20</td><td><a name="talk:246542"><div class="authors"><a href="person249.html" class="person">Thilina Ratnayaka</a>, <a class="person" href="person250.html">Paul Fischer</a> and <a href="person182.html" class="person">Luke Olson</a></div></a><div class="title">Fast coarse grid solvers for the solution of exascale Poisson equations</div><div class="presenter">PRESENTER: <a href="person249.html" class="person">Thilina Ratnayaka</a></div><div class="abstract"><p>ABSTRACT. p-multigrid (pMG) is a widely used multilevel preconditioner for high-order
spectral element and finite element methods (SEM/FEM). pMG consists of
a series of nested meshes with decreasing polynomial orders starting from a fine
mesh with a higher order (usually, p=7--8) to a coarse mesh with a lower order
(usually, p=1). In the SEM, which is essentially a nodal-based matrix-free finite
element method, finer level relaxations are performed with fast tensor product
operations that are largely local and require only nearest neighbor
communication.  However, solving the coarse grid problem, which is essential
for fast convergence, requires global all-to-all communication since the
inverse of coarse operator is completely dense.  The size of the coarse
problem, which comprises p=1 elements on an unstructured mesh, is
approximately equal to the number of elements in the SEM mesh.  With exascale
platforms, it is not uncommon to have more than a billion elements, so the
communication-intensive coarse-grid problem presents a formidable computational
challenge. Fast coarse solvers for pMG are essential for high performance SEM.</p><p>The author presents a scalable two-level Schwarz method for the solution of the
coarse problem that targets GPU-based exascale systems.  The levels consist of
a fully local problem in the p=1 space that is solved in parallel and which
requires only a pair of near-neighbor data exchanges pre- and post-solve.  This
local solve is followed (either additively or multiplicatively) by a
reduced-space solve on a very coarse system having approximately 4P unknowns,
where P is the number of MPI ranks (i.e., GPUs).  This reduced-space problem
is solved cooperatively by all the processes. A novel contribution of this work
is the introduction of a structured, non-nested, space for the reduced-space
problem which enables communication-free interpolation between the p=1 and
reduced spaces.  We design the reduced space such that it is small enough to be
solved using a fast, communication-minimal, sparse direct method while still
retaining reasonable approximation properties compared to algebraic multigrid (AMG).
Our sparse direct solver completes in a time that is comparable to a single
all-reduce.  We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed two level Schwarz
method by comparing it to the state of the art AMG solver found in BoomerAMG by
doing a series of experiments using NekRS, a highly scalable incompressible
Navier-Stokes solver on GPUs. Results are presented on the Frontier exascale
supercomputer at Oak Ridge Leadership Computing Facility.</p></div></td></tr></table></div><div class="session notalk"><a name="session:80871"><div class="heading"><span class="interval">18:15-19:00</span> <span class="title">Cash bar at Copper Conference Center</span></div></a></div><div class="session notalk"><a name="session:80872"><div class="heading"><span class="interval">19:00-21:30</span> <span class="title">Banquet at Copper Conference Center</span></div></a></div></div>
